# FizzBuzz Application

This is a simple Java application that implements the classic **FizzBuzz** problem. The program takes a user-defined range and prints the numbers from `1` to the given value with the following rules:

- For multiples of **3**, print `"Fizz"`.
- For multiples of **5**, print `"Buzz"`.
- For multiples of both **3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
- All other numbers are printed as-is.

Each output is separated by a semicolon (`;`), and all results are displayed on a single line for better readability.

## Features

- **Dynamic Range Input**: Users can specify the upper limit for the FizzBuzz sequence.
- **Clean and Optimized Output**: Results are formatted neatly on a single line with proper delimiters.
- **Efficient Implementation**: Uses modular arithmetic and minimal string operations for optimal performance.
